# Testing Neuro Desktop
Neuro Desktop cannot be tested via Github Actions, as we cannot directly confirm if the application did those actions or not.
So unit-testing must be done by the person who is working on a feature (inside their machine. But you can also use a different machine if you prefer).

There are multiple languages used in Neuro Desktop, and Javascript is used for these unit-tests (mostly because I know JS best - Me, Cassitly).
