## GitHub Issues Verification

### `Nakashireyumi/neuro-desktop` (14 open)

1. [#22](https://github.com/Nakashireyumi/neuro-desktop/issues/22) `Fix critical bugs and code quality issues from PR #19 review`
   - Status: likely stale for this branch.
   - Verification: references files from older layout (`repository-setup.js`, legacy python client) that are not part of the current Rust/Go/Python rewrite tree.

2. [#21](https://github.com/Nakashireyumi/neuro-desktop/issues/21) `Actions that enables the keyboard fails`
   - Status: partially fixed in this fork.
   - Fixes here: key validation in Python keyboard controller + Rust IPC now propagates execution/clear failures instead of silently discarding them.
   - Remaining: end-to-end test against live desktop interaction.

3. [#20](https://github.com/Nakashireyumi/neuro-desktop/issues/20) `Implement Permissions System for Neuro Desktop`
   - Status: partially fixed in this fork.
   - Fixes here: policy file support (`NEURO_PERMISSIONS_FILE`) with allow/deny/default behavior and action-level enforcement in Go integration.
   - Remaining: richer scopes (filesystem/process/network), UI policy editor, signed policy distribution.

4. [#16](https://github.com/Nakashireyumi/neuro-desktop/issues/16) `UI token synchronization issues`
   - Status: partially fixed in this fork.
   - Fixes here: optional bundled relay runtime (`NEURO_RELAY_ENABLED`) with automatic process supervision and restart.
   - Remaining: UI token synchronization flow and relay-first UX defaults.

5. [#15](https://github.com/Nakashireyumi/neuro-desktop/issues/15) `Neuro Desktop SDK`
   - Status: not fixed yet.
   - Remaining work: plugin SDK + versioned API.

6. [#14](https://github.com/Nakashireyumi/neuro-desktop/issues/14) `Neuro Integrations Manager`
   - Status: not fixed yet.
   - Remaining work: package/index manager and install/update flow.

7. [#13](https://github.com/Nakashireyumi/neuro-desktop/issues/13) `virtualized environment`
   - Status: not fixed in this repository.
   - Remaining work: external environment integration.

8. [#12](https://github.com/Nakashireyumi/neuro-desktop/issues/12) `permissions`
   - Status: partially fixed and overlaps issue #20.
   - Remaining work: same as #20.

9. [#11](https://github.com/Nakashireyumi/neuro-desktop/issues/11) `UI`
   - Status: not fixed yet.
   - Remaining work: production UI and marketplace UX.

10. [#8](https://github.com/Nakashireyumi/neuro-desktop/issues/8) `higher-level action abstractions`
    - Status: partially fixed in this fork.
    - Fixes here: added high-level script commands (`OPEN_WINDOWS_MENU`, `SHOW_DESKTOP`, `MINIMIZE_ALL_WINDOWS`, `CLOSE_FOREGROUND_APP`, `OPEN_TASK_MANAGER`, `CLOSE_ALL_APPS`) plus tests/docs.
    - Remaining: policy gating and richer intent planner.

11. [#5](https://github.com/Nakashireyumi/neuro-desktop/issues/5) `Setup file`
    - Status: likely outdated.
    - Verification: mentions `windows-api` package setup from older architecture; current codebase uses bundled Python runtime and separate modules.

12. [#4](https://github.com/Nakashireyumi/neuro-desktop/issues/4) `Action schema`
    - Status: fixed in this fork.
    - Fixes here: added `integration-docs/action-schema.run_script.json` and aligned script documentation with parser behavior.

13. [#3](https://github.com/Nakashireyumi/neuro-desktop/issues/3) `Move neuro-specific configs over from windows-api`
    - Status: likely outdated for current architecture.

14. [#2](https://github.com/Nakashireyumi/neuro-desktop/issues/2) `Provide built-in neuro integrations`
    - Status: partially fixed in this fork.
    - Fixes here: optional relay bundling/startup path in Rust app and bundle scripts.
    - Remaining: curated integration catalog and installer UX.
