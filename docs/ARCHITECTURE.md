# Architecture

Neuro Desktop lets Neuro-sama use a desktop. It runs as **three programs** and a web
page:

* the **server** (`neuro-integration`) receives Neuro's commands, applies Vedal's policy,
  and does the heavy work (the dashboard API, the vision client, the relay);
* the **dashboard program** (`neuro-dashboard`) serves the dashboard page and forwards
  its API to the server. It is optional: the server serves the page too;
* the **client** (`neuro-client`) runs on the PC Neuro controls. It carries out the
  commands the server sends, and nothing else.

The split exists so that the PC Neuro controls does not need to be powerful. The heavy
work runs on the server, and that PC only needs the client.

## Components

| Component | Where | Language | Role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Server | `desktop/apps/neuro-integration` | Go | Everything Neuro can reach, and every gate between Neuro and the machine |
| Client (`neuro-client`) | `desktop/backend/python/controller`, entry `desktop/apps/neuro-client`, packaged by `desktop/scripts/build-client.sh` | Python (stdlib-first), PyInstaller | Executes commands on the PC Neuro controls; reconnects on its own. Also run from source as `python3 -m controller.agent` |
| Dashboard program | `desktop/apps/neuro-dashboard` | Go (stdlib only) | Serves the dashboard page and forwards `/api` and `/health` to the server. Optional |
| Go client (slice 1, not shipped) | `desktop/apps/neuro-client-go` | Go (stdlib only) | The port of the client under way: the executor link, status, shell and lifecycle. Input and screen are not ported yet |
| Dashboard page | `desktop/frontend` | TypeScript | Vedal's controls. The server serves it at `/ui/`; the dashboard program serves it too |
| Relay host | the server binary, `relay` subcommand | Go | Neuro Relay socket for integrations and watchers |
| Vision | `desktop/apps/nd-vision-server` | Python (stdlib HTTP) | Optional screen description for `game_observe` |
| MCP servers | catalog-installed | any | Optional tools, started only after Vedal enables them |
| Test tools | `desktop/tools/` | Python | `fake-executor` (protocol simulator), `ollama-neuro` (small-model tester) |

The Go SDK port is vendored under `desktop/apps/neuro-integration/third_party/`
and pinned in `go.mod`.

## How a command flows

1. Neuro sends an action over the Neuro API websocket.
2. The server checks, in order: the **stop switch** (paused, or the kill-switch
   file exists), the **permission policy** (is the action's scope allowed, or
   requestable?), and the **per-scope rate limit**. A refusal is returned to
   Neuro with a message that says what to do next. The refusal is audited.
3. The command goes to an **agent** connected to the executor hub. If no agent is
   connected and one runs on the same machine, the server falls back to file IPC
   (`NEURO_IPC_FILE`).
4. The agent runs it and reports back. The server answers Neuro's `action/result`
   early, then sends the output as context when it arrives, for long commands.

Watcher commands from the relay take the same path, with the same gates
(`denyRelayCommand` in `relay.go`).

## Where state lives

| State | Where | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Policy | `NEURO_PERMISSIONS_FILE` (`permissions.json`) | the example is `desktop/config/permissions.example.json` |
| Permission requests and approvals | in memory, shown on the Permissions page | Neuro asks; Vedal approves or denies. A restart clears both |
| Audit | `NEURO_AUDIT_LOG` (JSON lines) | refusals, accepted actions, relay commands, policy changes |
| Extension state | `NEURO_EXTENSIONS_STATE_FILE` (runtime, not tracked by Git) | what is installed and enabled |
| Catalog | `desktop/catalog/index.json`, `publishers.json` | signed; the bridge verifies every item |

## Decisions

* **Three programs, split at the process boundary.** The server and the dashboard
  program are Go; the client is the Python agent packaged with PyInstaller as
  `neuro-client`. The split puts the power on the server, not on the PC Neuro
  controls. The first version of this decision deferred a full rewrite of the client
  into Go, because the input and capture code cannot be run on Windows or macOS from the
  development environment. **The maintainer then chose to start the Go client now.** That
  is the work in progress in `desktop/apps/neuro-client-go`: slice 1 covers the executor
  link, the headless rules, `get_status`, `shell_command` and the lifecycle commands,
  with the same firewall and messages as the Python client. Input, screen, window and
  `run_script` commands are refused there and still run only in the Python client. The
  Go client is not in the bundle yet. The next slices, and the rule for when the Python
  client can be retired, are in `docs/PRODUCTION_TODO.md`.
* **Screenshots travel as bytes, never as paths.** The server may run on another PC.
  The old design had the server open the path that the agent named, which was an
  arbitrary-file-read risk. The status reply now carries `screenshot_png_b64`, and the
  server checks the bytes before use. See `docs/EXECUTOR_PROTOCOL.md`.
* **Two languages on the machine: Go and Python**, plus the TypeScript dashboard.
  Rust and C++ were removed from the shipped path, and `tools/ci/repo_checks.py`
  fails if they come back. The history is in `CHANGELOG.md`.
* **One setup step, one shared secret file.** `neuro-integration setup` creates the
  relay token, which the relay host and the server both read. The dashboard never pushes
  tokens to another process. The dashboard token is printed once and kept only as a hash.
  This answers upstream issue Nakashireyumi/neuro-desktop#16, which asked how the UI and a
  relay that the bundle did not ship keep their tokens in step.
* **Development builds are separate.** The unsigned-extension switch
  (`NEURO_EXTENSIONS_ALLOW_UNSIGNED`) compiles in only with `-tags neurodev`, which the
  development bundle uses. A release build has no way to turn it on, and it logs once
  that the variable is ignored.
* **The server does not start other programs.** It does not start a relay, and it
  does not supervise the agent. Operators run each process (or the bundle's
  `start.sh` / `start.bat`) and point the server at the others.
* **No native tray.** The dashboard is served by the server and works without a
  display, which the headless target needs. A tray could not be built or verified
  in this environment, so it was not added. That is an explicit decision, not an
  oversight. See `docs/PRODUCTION_TODO.md`.
* **Headless first.** On a machine with no display (`NEURO_HEADLESS=1`), the agent
  runs its command-line parts and the server still serves the dashboard and the
  policy. CI runs the agent with no display as a regression test.
* **The default is closed.** Without a policy file the server uses a built-in
  default, and an action is denied unless its scope is on. Input, process,
  network, vision, and game are on; filesystem, system, shell, and extensions are
  off. `desktop_guide`, `reset_controls`, and `request_permission` are always
  allowed. Shell and system access need explicit consent.

## Security boundaries

* Client connections require the executor token (`NEURO_EXECUTOR_TOKEN`). The link is
  plain TCP until the pinned-TLS work in `docs/PRODUCTION_TODO.md` lands.
* The dashboard program adds no token and holds no secret. It forwards the caller's
  `X-ND-Token` (or `Authorization: Bearer`) to the server unchanged, and the server
  decides. It forwards only `/api/` and `/health`.
* The server reads no file that a client names (see screenshots, above).
* Every dashboard API call needs the dashboard token that `setup` makes. There is no
  exception for loopback. The server keeps only the token's SHA-256 hash.
* The relay refuses browsers, binary frames, and weak tokens. Its token comes from the
  relay token file that `setup` writes, which the server reads too. See `docs/RELAY.md`.
* Extensions must have a valid signature from a publisher in `publishers.json`.
  See `docs/SAFETY.md`.

## Testing

| Layer | Command | Where it runs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Server | `go test -race ./...` | CI on Linux, Windows and macOS (race detector on Linux) |
| Server, development build | `go test -race -tags neurodev ./...` | CI on Linux |
| Relay, MCP, vision, catalog, eval | see `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | their own CI jobs |
| Agent (client) | `python3 -m unittest discover backend/python/tests` | CI, with no display |
| Dashboard program | `go vet` and `go test ./...` in `desktop/apps/neuro-dashboard` | CI, all three systems |
| Client build | `desktop/scripts/build-client.sh`, then `neuro-client --help` | CI on Linux (`client-build` job) |
| Go client (slice 1) | `go vet` and `go test` in `desktop/apps/neuro-client-go`, including the command-set parity check with `agent.py`; cross-compile for three systems | CI, all three systems |
| Repository | `python3 desktop/tools/ci/repo_checks.py` | CI, first job |
| Dashboard | `npm run build` in `desktop/frontend` | CI |
| End to end | the `agent-e2e` job starts the server and the agent | CI |

What is **not** verified here: the client on a real Windows or macOS desktop
(input, screen capture), the PyInstaller build on Windows and macOS, and the dashboard
page visually. CI builds the server for those systems but cannot exercise the desktop.
