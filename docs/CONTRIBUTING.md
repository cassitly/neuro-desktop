## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

**Before submitting**, please:
1. Search existing issues to avoid duplicates
2. Test with the latest version
3. Try to isolate the problem

**When submitting**, include:
- **Clear title**: "Mouse movement fails on 4K displays"
- **Description**: What happened vs what should happen
- **Steps to reproduce**: Detailed, numbered steps
- **Environment**: OS, version, screen resolution
- **Logs**: Relevant error messages or logs
- **Screenshots**: If applicable

**Template**:
```markdown
## Bug Description
Brief description of the bug.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Start Neuro Desktop
2. Send action: `{"action": "move_mouse_to", "params": {"x": 5000, "y": 5000}}`
3. Observe crash

## Expected Behavior
Mouse should move to screen edge (clamped).

## Actual Behavior
Application crashes with "coordinate out of bounds".

## Environment
- OS: Windows 11
- Version: v0.0.3b-dev
- Screen: 3840x2160 (4K)

## Logs
```
[ERROR] Panic: coordinate overflow
```

### Requesting Features

**Before requesting**, check:
1. Is it already planned? (see [Roadmap](README.md#roadmap))
2. Has someone else requested it?
3. Is it aligned with project goals?

**When requesting**, include:
- **Problem statement**: What problem does this solve?
- **Proposed solution**: How should it work?
- **Alternatives**: What other solutions exist?
- **Use case**: Real-world scenario

**Template**:
```markdown
## Feature Request: OCR Screen Reading

### Problem
Neuro cannot see what's on screen, limiting her ability to interact contextually.

### Proposed Solution
Add an `OCR_READ` action that extracts text from a screen region.

### Alternative Solutions
- Screenshot + external OCR service
- Computer vision model integration

### Use Case
Neuro needs to read error messages from dialog boxes to decide next action.

### Additional Context
This would enable Neuro to play text-based games and navigate complex UIs.
```

### Improving Documentation

Documentation improvements are always welcome!

**Areas needing help**:
- Fixing typos and grammar
- Adding examples and tutorials
- Improving clarity
- Translating to other languages

**Process**:
1. Fork repository
2. Edit markdown files in `docs/`
3. Submit pull request
4. No need to build the project!

```

### Coding Standards

#### Rust

**Follow Rust conventions**:
```rust
// Use descriptive names
fn process_ipc_command() -> Result<()>  // ✓
fn proc() -> Result<()>                 // ✗

// Document public APIs
/// Processes an IPC command from the queue.
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `command` - The command to process
///
/// # Errors
/// Returns error if command is invalid
pub fn process_command(command: &str) -> Result<()>

// Handle errors properly
let result = some_operation()?;  // ✓
let result = some_operation().unwrap();  // ✗ (avoid unwrap)
```

**Run formatters**:
```bash
cargo fmt
cargo clippy
```

#### Go

**Follow Go conventions**:
```go
// Use camelCase for private, PascalCase for public
func processAction(action Action) error  // ✓
func ProcessAction(action Action) error  // ✗ (should be private)

// Document exported functions
// ProcessAction handles incoming Neuro actions
func ProcessAction(action Action) error

// Handle errors explicitly
if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("failed to process: %w", err)
}
```

**Run formatters**:
```bash
go fmt ./...
go vet ./...
```

#### Python

**Follow PEP 8**:
```python
# Use snake_case
def process_mouse_action(x: int, y: int):  # ✓
def ProcessMouseAction(x: int, y: int):    # ✗

# Type hints
def move_mouse(x: int, y: int) -> None:  # ✓

# Docstrings
def move_mouse(x: int, y: int) -> None:
    """
    Move mouse cursor to specified coordinates.
    
    Args:
        x: X coordinate in pixels
        y: Y coordinate in pixels
    """
```

**Run formatters**:
```bash
black backend/python/controller
pylint backend/python/controller
```

#### TypeScript

**Follow TypeScript best practices**:
```typescript
// Use interfaces for objects
interface MouseAction {
  x: number;
  y: number;
}

// Use const for immutable
const config: Config = loadConfig();  // ✓
let config: Config = loadConfig();    // ✗

// Explicit types
function moveMouse(action: MouseAction): void  // ✓
function moveMouse(action)                     // ✗
```

### Testing Guidelines

**Write tests for**:
- New features
- Bug fixes
- Edge cases

**Test structure**:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    
    #[test]
    fn test_mouse_move_valid_coordinates() {
        let cmd = IPCCommand::MoveMouseTo { x: 100, y: 200 };
        assert!(cmd.validate().is_ok());
    }
    
    #[test]
    fn test_mouse_move_negative_coordinates() {
        let cmd = IPCCommand::MoveMouseTo { x: -10, y: -10 };
        assert!(cmd.validate().is_err());
    }
}
```

**Run tests before submitting**:
```bash
cargo test
go test ./...
pytest backend/python/tests
```

### Commit Messages

**Format**:
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types**:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `style`: Formatting, missing semicolons, etc.
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes nor adds
- `perf`: Performance improvement
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Updating build tasks, package manager configs, etc.

**Examples**:

```
feat(mouse): add support for normalized coordinates

Adds MOVE_N and CLICK_N commands that use 0.0-1.0 coordinate ranges
instead of absolute pixels. This makes scripts resolution-independent.

Closes #42
```

```
fix(ipc): handle malformed JSON gracefully

Previously, malformed JSON would crash the IPC handler. Now it logs
the error and continues processing.

Fixes #87
```

```
docs(readme): add troubleshooting section

Added common issues and solutions to help new users.
```

### Branching Strategy

**Main branches**:
- `main` - Stable, production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for features

**Feature branches**:
- `feature/feature-name` - New features
- `fix/bug-name` - Bug fixes
- `docs/doc-topic` - Documentation
- `refactor/component-name` - Refactoring

**Example workflow**:
```bash
# Create feature branch from develop
git checkout develop
git pull upstream develop
git checkout -b feature/add-ocr-support

# Make changes, commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat(ocr): add OCR screen reading support"

# Push to your fork
git push origin feature/add-ocr-support

# Create pull request on GitHub
```

## Style Guides

### Code Comments

```rust
// Good: Explain WHY, not WHAT
// Clamp to prevent coordinate overflow on multi-monitor setups
let x = x.clamp(0, screen_width - 1);

// Bad: States the obvious
// Clamp x
let x = x.clamp(0, screen_width - 1);
```

### Error Messages

```rust
// Good: Actionable, specific
return Err("Failed to parse IPC command: missing 'type' field");

// Bad: Vague, unhelpful
return Err("Error");
```

### Variable Naming

```rust
// Good: Descriptive
let mouse_x_coordinate = 500;
let action_execution_timeout_ms = 1000;

// Bad: Too short or cryptic
let x = 500;
let t = 1000;
```

### File Organization

```rust
// Organize imports
use std::fs;           // Standard library
use anyhow::Result;    // External crates
use crate::config;     // Local modules

// Group related functions
impl IPCHandler {
    // Public API first
    pub fn new() -> Self { }
    pub fn process() -> Result<()> { }
    
    // Private helpers after
    fn validate() -> bool { }
    fn execute() -> Result<()> { }
}
```
