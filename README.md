## Overview

Neuro Desktop is a multi-language integration system that enables [Neuro-sama](https://twitch.tv/vedal987) to interact with desktop environments through a sophisticated action scripting language. The system bridges AI decision-making with real-world computer control through a carefully designed architecture that prioritizes safety, reliability, and human-like interaction patterns.

### What Makes Neuro Desktop Special?

- **Two languages on the machine**: Go (the server: Neuro API, permissions, audit, dashboard API, relay host) and Python (the agent that touches the machine), plus a TypeScript dashboard. The Rust and C++ parts were removed; see [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).
- **Human-Like Mouse Movement**: Advanced algorithmic pathfinding that mimics natural human mouse movements with Bézier curves and Perlin noise
- **Powerful Script Language**: Simple yet expressive action scripting for complex automation tasks
- **Automatic Recovery**: Built-in crash detection and automatic process restart capabilities
- **Cross-Platform**: Windows, Linux, and macOS — high-level intents resolve to OS-native shortcuts
- **Operator Controls**: Vedal can gate capabilities via scoped permission policies

## Features

See **[docs/CAPABILITIES.md](docs/CAPABILITIES.md)** for an honest “what works today” list
(bridge/executor, actions, permissions, platforms, and what’s still stubbed).

### Core Capabilities

- Mouse / keyboard control with human-like pathfinding
- Action script language for multi-step workflows
- Bridge ↔ executor over TCP (same PC or remote controlled machine)
- Scoped permission policies for Vedal / operators
- Cross-platform intents (Windows-solid; Linux/macOS best-effort)
- Local Ollama+RWKV7 Neuro API mock for integration testing

## Architecture

Neuro Desktop is a **server + agent** pair with a browser **client**. Per the
[Neuro SDK](https://github.com/VedalAI/neuro-sdk), the server is a WebSocket
**client** of Neuro's API server. Internally:

- **Server** — `neuro-integration` (Go) talks to Neuro, owns the permission
  policy, audit log, game catalog and relay link, serves the dashboard, and
  listens for agents on TCP `:9876` (or uses file IPC on the same machine).
- **Agent** — `desktop/backend/python/controller/agent.py` runs on the PC Neuro
  controls (`python3 -m controller.agent --bridge host:9876`) and is the only
  process that touches that machine.
- **Dashboard client** — the TypeScript frontend, served by the server at
  `/ui/`; the admin's browser is the client in the client-server sense.

```

└──────────────────┘                   └─────────────────────────────┘
```

`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` explains the consolidation (Rust and C++ are no longer on
the shipping path), `docs/EXECUTOR_PROTOCOL.md` is the server↔agent wire format,
and `docs/RELAY.md` covers coexisting with other integrations.

### Split-machine quick start

```bash
# PC that runs Neuro (server)
./neuro-integration --ws-url ws://localhost:8000 --executor-listen 0.0.0.0:9876

# PC Neuro should control (agent) — graphical session, NO sudo
cd desktop/backend/python && python3 -m controller.agent --bridge <server-lan-ip>:9876
```

The same machine is the default: run the agent with no arguments (loopback hub)
or point `NEURO_IPC_FILE` at a shared path for file IPC.

### Operator dashboard

The bridge serves the dashboard itself — no separate server, no `file://` page:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8300/ui/
```

- **Extensions** — install / enable / disable / uninstall from the catalog
  (`desktop/catalog/index.json`), with the install mode (metadata, git clone, MCP).
- **Games** — profiles found on this machine, the game detected right now, the live
  session (mode, actions issued), "show me what Neuro sees", and a
  **release all input** panic button.
- **Permissions** — scopes (input, game, filesystem, process, network, system,
  vision), per-scope actions-per-minute limits, and explicit allow/deny lists.
  `Save` applies the policy to the running bridge immediately.
- **Status** — version, executor connection, relay peers, reserved actions, paths.

Writes are guarded by `NEURO_ADMIN_TOKEN`. The dashboard pages served to a local
browser carry the token as `window.__ND_BOOTSTRAP`; from another machine, paste it
into the Status tab. Reads stay open on loopback so `curl http://127.0.0.1:8300/api/status`
works while debugging.

Try it without a display, a Windows box, or pyautogui — the repo ships a protocol
simulator that never touches your real mouse or keyboard:

```bash
# Terminal 1: pretend to be the executor (reports "Minecraft" as the active window)
python3 desktop/tools/fake-executor/fake_executor.py --addr 127.0.0.1:9876

# Terminal 2: the bridge + dashboard
cd desktop/apps/neuro-integration
NEURO_UI_DIR=../frontend/dist NEURO_ADMIN_TOKEN=demo go run .
```

### Playing games

Neuro Desktop can play a game two ways, and picks the right one per game:

1. **Alongside a dedicated integration** (Minecraft, osu!, ...). The game keeps its
   own integration; Neuro Desktop does not register the actions that integration
   owns (`NEURO_RESERVED_ACTIONS`, relay peers) and refuses to send input while the
   session is delegated (`control.mode: external`).
2. **On its own**, for anything without an integration: Neuro Desktop supplies the
   high-level interface (`game_list_profiles`, `game_detect`, `game_start_session`,
   `game_move`, `game_look`, `game_action`, `game_press`, `game_observe`, ...), using
   the profile's keybinds and masked keys.

Profiles live in `desktop/catalog/games/*.json` (see
[the profile README](desktop/catalog/games/README.md)); ship one profile per game:

```json
{
  "id": "minecraft",
  "name": "Minecraft",
  "match": { "window_titles": ["Minecraft"], "processes": ["javaw"] },
  "control": { "mode": "auto", "external_integration": "minecraft",
               "mouse_look": { "enabled": true }, "move_hold_seconds": 0.6 },
  "keys": { "forward": "w", "jump": "space" }
}
```

`mode: auto` hands the game to the dedicated integration when it is connected
(through the relay) and drives it from Neuro Desktop otherwise. Override it per
session from the dashboard or with the `mode` parameter of `game_start_session`
(`auto`, `nd`, `external`, `hybrid`). `generic-keyboard-mouse.json` is the fallback
profile for games nobody wrote a profile for.

### Headless machines (no display, command line only)

Neuro Desktop runs on a server, container, SSH session or CI runner with no
graphical session. Nothing has to be installed for it: mouse and keyboard
libraries are loaded only when a display actually exists, and `NEURO_HEADLESS`
forces the mode either way.

```bash
# A CLI-only box: no X/Wayland, no pyautogui/pynput/mss needed
export NEURO_HEADLESS=1                    # optional: auto-detected when DISPLAY is unset
export NEURO_SHELL_ALLOWLIST="ls,cat,python3,git"   # programs Neuro may run (empty = none)
export NEURO_SHELL_TIMEOUT=20              # seconds per command (max 120)
export NEURO_SHELL_CWD=/srv/work
export NEURO_ADMIN_TOKEN="pick-a-secret"   # required before exposing the dashboard

cd desktop/apps/neuro-integration && go run .
```

What changes on a headless machine:

- **`shell_command` is the capability that matters.** Neuro runs one command line
  per call and gets the exit code plus truncated stdout/stderr back, which is what
  a weak model needs to decide the next step: `shell_command {"command": "ls -la"}`.
- Mouse, keyboard, screenshot and game actions answer with a clear message
  ("no display session ... use the shell_command action") instead of crashing the
  controller at import time, which is what used to happen.
- `get_status` still reports platform, processes (from `/proc`, `psutil` optional)
  and screen size; there is simply no cursor or window to report.
- The dashboard, permissions, relay and game *registry* all work exactly as on a
  desktop, so Neuro can be pointed at a headless build during development.

The shell is fenced three times: the `shell` scope (off in every shipped example
policy, and not enabled by `default_allow`), the allowlist/denylist firewall, and
the same checks again inside the Python executor. Destructive patterns (`rm -rf /`,
`mkfs`, `shutdown`, `curl ... | sh`, `sudo`, `diskpart`, ...) are refused even when
the program is allowlisted; `NEURO_SHELL_DENYLIST` adds the operator's own
patterns.

### Seeing what it did (audit log) and stopping it

Two operator safety systems sit in front of every action:

```bash
export NEURO_PAUSED=1                              # start paused
export NEURO_KILL_SWITCH_FILE=/run/nd/STOP         # actions refuse while this file exists
export NEURO_AUDIT_LOG=/var/log/neuro-desktop.jsonl # one JSON line per decision
export NEURO_DENY_ACTIONS="type_text,key_press"     # a hard deny list the dashboard cannot undo
```

- `POST /api/control/pause` and `POST /api/control/resume` toggle the brake from
  the dashboard; `GET /api/control` shows the current state, and input release /
  status / session-end actions are always allowed so nothing stays stuck down.
- The kill-switch file is checked once per second; creating it stops action
  execution immediately and removing it resumes. Actions answer with the reason
  and the file name, so a model knows to wait rather than retry.
- `GET /api/audit?limit=100` returns the tail of the audit log
  (`{"time","event","action","decision","reason"}`); `NEURO_DENY_ACTIONS` is
  merged into the policy at load time and survives dashboard edits.

### Component Breakdown

| Component | Language | Role |
|-----------|----------|------|
| **neuro-integration** | Go | **Server**: Neuro API, permissions, audit, game interface, dashboard API, executor hub |
| **controller/agent.py** | Python | **Agent**: input control, script parsing, shell, telemetry (the only part that touches the machine) |
| **controller/\*** | Python | Drivers the agent uses: `actions`, `desktop`, `shell`, `platform_intents`, `controls/` |
| **frontend** | TypeScript | **Dashboard client**, served by the server at `/ui/` |
| **relay host** (`neuro-integration relay`) | Go | Neuro Relay intermediary: lets other integrations and Neuro-OS watchers share the connection |
| **nd-vision-server** | Python | Optional vision service the server calls through `NEURO_VISION_URL` (stdlib HTTP, Pillow optional) |
| **MCP servers** | any | Optional extension servers. The server starts one only after Vedal enables it on the Extensions page |

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Go 1.22+ — the server (required)
# Download from https://go.dev/dl/

# Python 3.10+ — the agent (required)
python3 --version

# Node.js 18+ — only to build the dashboard client
node --version

```

### Installation

**Option 1: Pre-built bundle** (recommended)

1. Download the latest release archive
2. Extract it anywhere
3. Run `start.bat` (Windows) or `./start.sh` (Linux/macOS): that starts the
   server, the local agent and the dashboard together

**Option 2: Build from Source**

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/cassitly/neuro-desktop.git
cd neuro-desktop/desktop

# Run automated build
.\scripts\build-all.ps1  # Windows
./scripts/build-all.sh   # Linux/macOS
```

### First Run

```bash
# 1. Server + dashboard (PC that runs Neuro)
cd desktop/apps/neuro-integration && go build -o neuro-integration . && ./neuro-integration

# 2. Agent (PC Neuro should control; the same machine in a dev setup)
cd desktop/backend/python && python3 -m controller.agent --bridge 127.0.0.1:9876

# 3. Dashboard
#    http://127.0.0.1:8300/ui/
```

Or stage the whole thing at once: `./scripts/bundle/dev.sh` (Linux/macOS) /
`.\scripts\bundle\dev.ps1` (Windows). The server prints every connection attempt,
so you can see immediately whether Neuro, the agent and the dashboard are up.

## Usage

### Basic Example

Once running, Neuro can execute commands like:

```javascript
// Move mouse to center of screen
{
  "action": "move_mouse_to",
  "params": { "x": 960, "y": 540 }
}

// Type text
{
  "action": "type_text",
  "params": { "text": "Hello from Neuro!" }
}

// Execute complex script
{
  "action": "run_script",
  "params": {
    "script": `
      TYPE "notepad"
      ENTER
      WAIT 1
      TYPE "Hello World!"
    `
  }
}
```

### Action Script Language

The script language supports powerful multi-command sequences:

```text
# Open application
SHORTCUT win
TYPE "notepad"
ENTER
WAIT 1

# Type content
TYPE "Dear User,"
ENTER
TYPE "This is Neuro!"
ENTER

# Save file
SHORTCUT ctrl s
WAIT 0.5
TYPE "neuro_message.txt"
ENTER
```

See [Action Script Documentation](docs/action_script/LANGUAGE_REFERENCE.md) for complete reference.

### Configuration

The server reads its settings from environment variables and command-line flags. There is no
configuration file to edit. The full list is in [desktop/README.md](desktop/README.md#configuration).

```bash
# Linux / macOS
export NEURO_SDK_WS_URL=ws://localhost:8000     # the Neuro API (the default)
export NEURO_ADMIN_LISTEN=127.0.0.1:8300        # the dashboard (the default)
export NEURO_EXECUTOR_TOKEN=change-me           # the secret every agent presents
```

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell)
$env:NEURO_SDK_WS_URL = "ws://localhost:8000"
$env:NEURO_EXECUTOR_TOKEN = "change-me"
```

## Development

### Local Neuro API tester (Ollama + RWKV7)

In-repo stand-in for [Randy](https://github.com/VedalAI/neuro-sdk/tree/main/Randy) that
can also pick actions with [heredos/rwkv7:2.9b](https://ollama.com/heredos/rwkv7):

```bash
cd desktop/tools/ollama-neuro
./setup.sh
./run.sh --mode ollama --warm    # ws://127.0.0.1:8000 + http://127.0.0.1:1337/
# Instant IPC debugging without waiting on the LLM:
./run.sh --mode manual
```

On CPU laptops (e.g. Dell Latitude E7490), cold model load can take minutes —
use `--warm` / `--keep-alive -1`, or stay on `manual`/`random` while wiring IPC.
Details: [`desktop/tools/ollama-neuro/README.md`](desktop/tools/ollama-neuro/README.md).

### Fake executor (no display needed)

`desktop/tools/fake-executor/fake_executor.py` speaks the executor protocol against
the bridge and never generates input, so the dashboard, the permission checks and
the game interface can be exercised on any machine (including CI and macOS):

```bash
python3 desktop/tools/fake-executor/fake_executor.py --addr 127.0.0.1:9876
```

Run it before the bridge to see the executor as *connected* and a game as detected.

### Docker Modular Tests

Run modular tests in Docker:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.tests.yml run --rm go-integration-tests
docker compose -f docker-compose.tests.yml run --rm python-parser-tests
```

### Coexistence with other integrations (Neuro Relay)

[Neuro Relay](https://github.com/Nakashireyumi/neuro-relay) multiplexes several
integrations behind one Neuro connection. Neuro Desktop participates as a relay
*integration* — it does not spawn the relay, which is a Python service with its own
YAML config:

```bash
export NEURO_RELAY_ENABLED=true
export NEURO_RELAY_URL="ws://127.0.0.1:8765"     # relay intermediary socket
export NEURO_RELAY_TOKEN="super-secret-token"    # intermediary.auth_token
export NEURO_RELAY_NAME="Neuro Desktop"
export NEURO_RESERVED_ACTIONS="minecraft_place_block,osu_click"
```

There are two ways to coexist, and they are complementary:

1. **Share one Neuro connection (recommended for games).** Point the bridge's own
   Neuro API client at the relay's Nakurity Backend instead of at Neuro
   (`NEURO_SDK_WS_URL=ws://127.0.0.1:8001`, the `nakurity-backend` port in the
   relay's `authentication.yaml`). The bridge then looks like any other Neuro SDK
   client to the relay: it sends `startup` (`game: "Neuro Desktop"`) and
   `actions/register`, and the relay multiplexes everything to the real backend.
   This is the path that makes "run alongside an existing game integration" work
   with no extra configuration.
2. **Look in on / be driven by the relay (operator visibility).** With
   `NEURO_RELAY_ENABLED=true` the bridge registers on the relay's intermediary
   socket (`ws://127.0.0.1:8765`) as `{"type":"integration","name":...,
   "auth_token":...}`, publishes its action schemas, and accepts `cmd` envelopes
   from Neuro-OS watchers — each one still subject to the same permission policy,
   pause flag and kill switch as Neuro's own calls. Note that the relay's
   intermediary keeps registrations for watchers; it does not forward them to
   Neuro, which is exactly why mode 1 exists.

### Neuro Relay (Go host)

Neuro Relay's intermediary (the socket integrations and Neuro-OS watchers connect to) is built into the server as a subcommand. It replaces the earlier Python shim, and the server no longer starts any relay process itself.

```bash
cd desktop/apps/neuro-integration
# Relay: integrations and watchers connect here (ws)
NEURO_RELAY_AUTH_TOKEN=change-me-to-a-long-random-value \
  go run . relay --listen 127.0.0.1:8765 --health 127.0.0.1:8766
```

- With no `NEURO_RELAY_AUTH_TOKEN`, the host generates a token, stores it in `NEURO_RELAY_TOKEN_FILE` (default `./relay-token`, mode 0600), and logs where it is. The sample token from the upstream project is refused.
- `GET /health` on the health address reports the connected integrations, the watchers, and whether the optional Neuro link is up. It shows names and counts only.
- The bridge connects as a relay client with `NEURO_RELAY_ENABLED=true`, `NEURO_RELAY_URL=ws://127.0.0.1:8765`, and `NEURO_RELAY_TOKEN` set to the same value. The dashboard's Extensions page shows the live relay state.
- Browsers are refused (any request with an `Origin` header), binary frames are refused, and each connection has a frame-rate limit.
- A watcher with `NEURO_RELAY_NEURO_OS_TOKEN` (a second, enhanced token) can send `direct_to_neuro` messages, but only when the host has `NEURO_RELAY_NEURO_URL` set to a Neuro API server.

The upstream Python relay speaks the same socket, so the bridge can connect to it too. The bridge does not start it for you. Full details and the protocol are in [docs/RELAY.md](docs/RELAY.md).

### Development Workflow

```bash
# 1. Setup development environment
.\scripts\setup-dev.ps1

# 2. Build all components
make all

# 3. Run in development mode
.\scripts\bundle\dev.ps1

# 4. Run tests
(cd apps/neuro-integration && go test ./...)   # server tests, including the relay, MCP, vision and catalog suites
python3 -m unittest discover backend/python/tests -t backend/python   # agent tests

# 5. Build production bundle
.\scripts\bundle\prod.ps1
```

### Adding New Actions

1. **Define it** in `desktop/apps/neuro-integration/action-registry.go`: a `CommandType` constant, then an `actionSpec` in `HLActionSpecs` or `LLActionSpecs` with the name, a description that ends with a one-line example, and the parameter schema.
2. **Build the command** in `buildIPCCommand` (same file). Reject bad input there with a message that names the parameter and shows a valid example. That text is what a small model reads on its next turn.
3. **Give it a scope** in `desktop/apps/neuro-integration/permissions.go` (`actionScope`). Actions without a scope follow `default_allow`. Only actions that cannot start anything belong in `alwaysAllowed`.
4. **Connect the executor** if the command runs on the machine: add it to the allowlist in `executor_commands.go`, and handle it in the Python agent (`desktop/backend/python/controller/agent.py`).
5. **Test it**: add the call a small model would make to `desktop/apps/neuro-integration/testdata/weak_model_cases.json` with the expected verdict and reply text, then run `go test ./...`.

### Testing with Randy

Randy is a mock Neuro API server for testing:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Randy
cd Randy
npm install
npm start

# Terminal 2: Run Neuro Desktop
cd desktop/apps/neuro-integration
go run .
```

Randy will send random actions to test your integration.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**`EACCES` / Permission denied on `frontend/dist`**

Leftover from a `sudo` bundle. Fix ownership, never rebuild as root:

```bash
cd desktop
sudo chown -R "$USER:$USER" frontend/dist dist backend/python/.venv
./scripts/bundle/dev.sh
```

**"Go integration binary not found"**
```bash
# Rebuild Go integration
cd apps/neuro-integration
go build -o neuro-integration.exe .
cp neuro-integration.exe ../neuro-desktop/target/release/
```

**"Failed to initialize Python controller"**
```bash
# Reinstall Python dependencies
cd backend/python
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**"WebSocket connection failed"**
```bash
# Check if Randy or Neuro API is running
curl ws://localhost:8000
# Or start Randy
cd Randy && npm start
```
