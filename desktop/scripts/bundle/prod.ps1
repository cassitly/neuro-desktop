Neuro Desktop Control System
=============================

This is a self-contained bundle of Neuro Desktop.

Contents:
  - neuro-desktop.exe         Main application (Rust)
  - go-neuro-integration.exe  Neuro API connector (Go)
  - python/                   Python runtime and drivers
  - frontend/                 Web UI assets

To run:
  1. Double-click neuro-desktop.exe
  2. Or run from terminal: .\neuro-desktop.exe

Environment Variables (optional):
  - NEURO_SDK_WS_URL    WebSocket URL for Neuro API
                        Default: ws://localhost:8000
  
  - NEURO_IPC_FILE      Path to IPC file
                        Default: ./neuro_ipc.json

The Go integration binary will be started automatically
by the main Rust binary. You don't need to run it manually.
