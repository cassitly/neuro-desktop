# Build everything the shipped product needs on Linux / macOS / Git Bash / WSL.
#
# The shipped product is three programs and a web page:
#   * the Go server (apps/neuro-integration) — talks to Neuro, enforces the
#     permission policy, hosts the relay and the dashboard API;
#   * the Go dashboard program (apps/neuro-dashboard) — serves the dashboard and
#     forwards its API to the server (optional; for split setups);
#   * the Python agent (backend/python/controller) — the only process that
#     touches the machine Neuro controls (runs on the PC being controlled;
#     scripts/build-client.sh packages it as the neuro-client program);
#   * the TypeScript dashboard (frontend), which the server serves at /ui/.
#
#   ./scripts/build-all.sh            # build + test
