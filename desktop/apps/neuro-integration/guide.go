// The guide exists for small models. A 2B-parameter model that is handed 50

// forget that it must start a session before it can move. Two things fix most of
// that, and both live here:
//
//   - one plain-text cheat sheet (this file), available as the `desktop_guide`
//     action and pushed once as context after startup,
//   - error messages that name the scope, the fix, and the next action to call
//     (see policyDenialMessage and rateLimitDenial).
//
// The rule of thumb for the wording: two sentences or fewer per action, the
// exact parameter names, one example, and an explicit order of operations.

// CmdDesktopGuide is the "tell me how to use you" action.

## Neuro Desktop — how to use it

Rules that matter more than any single action:

1. Call ONE action at a time and wait for its result before the next one.
2. If an action is refused, the message says which permission scope is off. Do
   not retry it; either ask Vedal to enable that scope, or use another action.
3. Coordinates are screen pixels: x grows to the right, y grows DOWN.
   (0,0) is the top-left corner. Read the screen size from get_status first if
   you are unsure.
4. Type text with type_text, press keys with key_press, combine keys with
   key_combo (e.g. ctrl+c). Use run_script only when you need a sequence.

Everyday actions:

- get_status -> mouse position, screen size, active window, running processes.
- move_mouse_to {x, y} -> moves the pointer (no click).
- mouse_click {button: "left"|"right"|"middle"} -> clicks where the pointer is.
- type_text {text} -> types into whatever has focus. Click the target first.
- key_press {key} -> one key, e.g. "enter", "esc", "f1".
- key_combo {keys: ["ctrl","c"]} -> keys pressed together.
- run_script {script} -> several lines at once; see the script section below.
- desktop_guide -> this text.
- list_catalog_items / find_catalog_items -> extensions and plugins.
- desktop_context -> what the desktop looks like right now (may include a screenshot).

You can control this desktop. The essentials:

- Work one action at a time; wait for each result.
- Mouse: move_mouse_to {x,y} then mouse_click. y grows downward.
- Keyboard: type_text, key_press, key_combo {keys:[...]}.
- Games: game_detect, then game_start_session, then game_move / game_look / game_action.
- Command line: shell_command {command} (only if the shell scope and allowlist allow it).
- Unsure? Call desktop_guide for the full instruction sheet, or get_status for the
  current screen, window and processes.
